# Enchanted Launcher

**Enchanted Launcher** is a modern Minecraft launcher designed for players using Fabric versions. The project is currently in **early development**, but it already offers unique features that set it apart from the official launcher.

## Features

- **Fabric Version Support**  
  The launcher supports multiple Minecraft Fabric versions, and **we are actively adding support for new versions**:

  | Version | Fabric |
  |---------|--------|
  | 1.8.9   | ✅     |
  | 1.12.2  | ✅     |
  | 1.16.2  | ✅     |
  | 1.17.1  | ✅     |
  | 1.18.2  | ✅     |
  | 1.19.2  | ✅     |
  | 1.20.2  | ✅     |
  | 1.21.1  | ✅     |
  | 1.21.2  | ✅     |
  | 1.21.8  | ✅     |
  | 1.21.10 | ✅     |

- **Version-Specific Mods**  
  Unlike the official launcher, Enchanted Launcher allows mods to be assigned to specific versions. This means you can run version `1.21.8` with different mods than `1.21.4`, enabling **fast and easy version switching**.

- **Preloaded Mod Packs**  
  The launcher comes with ready-to-use mod packs for **PvP** and **optimization**, so you can get started without manually installing mods.

- **Mods Tab**  
  A dedicated "Mods" tab lets you browse all supported versions and add your own mods for each specific version.

- **Non-Premium Player Support**  
  No Minecraft account required – just enter your nickname and start playing.
